# hello-world

This is test file.
I am studying to work with github.
I created new repository where I can store ideas, resources and programs.
Then in this repository I created new branch. Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
Now I am making changes and want to commit it. Saved changes are called commits.
